# Typewriter Mode Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to enhance the typewriter mode with a more focused writing experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Focus Window Size
- **Before**: Current line ± 2 lines (5 total lines in focus)
- **After**: Current line ± 1 line (3 total lines in focus)
- **Impact**: Creates a tighter, more concentrated focus area

### 2. Enhanced Dimming Effect
- **Before**: Medium gray dimming (`#666666`)
- **After**: Dark gray dimming (`#333333`)
- **Impact**: Stronger contrast between focused and dimmed content

### 3. Updated Default Configuration
- Changed `typewriterFocusLines` default from `2` to `1`
- Updated all documentation to reflect the new default
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing configurations

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

#### Core Implementation (`src/editor/buffer-editor.js`)
- Updated default `typewriterFocusLines` from 2 to 1
- Changed dimming color from `#666666-fg` to `#333333-fg`
- Updated configuration loading logic

#### Documentation Updates
- `TYPEWRITER_MODE.md`: Updated descriptions and examples
- `README-WRITERS-CLI.md`: Updated feature descriptions
- `src/editor/dialogs.js`: Updated help text
- `focused-typewriter-demo.txt`: Updated demo content

#### Testing
- `test-focused-window.js`: Updated tests for new settings
- `test-focused-typewriter.js`: Updated demo script descriptions
- Added `test-dimming-comparison.js`: Visual comparison tool

## User Experience Impact

### Visual Changes
- **Tighter Focus**: Only 3 lines visible (current + 1 above + 1 below)
- **Stronger Dimming**: Non-focused lines are significantly darker
- **Improved Contrast**: Focused content stands out more prominently

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Concentration**: Smaller focus window reduces distractions
2. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Stronger dimming creates clearer focus
3. **Reduced Eye Strain**: Less competing visual information
4. **Improved Writing Flow**: Natural spotlight effect on current work

### Configuration
- Default setting now provides maximum focus
- Users can still configure `typewriterFocusLines` to 2, 3, or higher for more context
- Setting is saved per-project in `writers.config.json`

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (±2 lines, medium dimming)
```
Line 1: [DIMMED - medium gray]
Line 2: [DIMMED - medium gray]
Line 3: [BRIGHT - full visibility]
Line 4: [BRIGHT - full visibility]
Line 5: [BRIGHT - current line]
Line 6: [BRIGHT - full visibility]
Line 7: [BRIGHT - full visibility]
Line 8: [DIMMED - medium gray]
Line 9: [DIMMED - medium gray]
```

### After (±1 line, dark dimming)
```
Line 1: [DIMMED - dark gray]
Line 2: [DIMMED - dark gray]
Line 3: [DIMMED - dark gray]
Line 4: [BRIGHT - full visibility]
Line 5: [BRIGHT - current line]
Line 6: [BRIGHT - full visibility]
Line 7: [DIMMED - dark gray]
Line 8: [DIMMED - dark gray]
Line 9: [DIMMED - dark gray]
```

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
- All existing typewriter mode tests pass
- New focused window tests verify correct dimming behavior
- Edge cases (document start/end) handled properly

### Interactive Testing
- `npm run test-focused-typewriter`: Interactive demo
- `npm run test-dimming-comparison`: Visual comparison tool
- `npm run test-focused-window`: Unit test validation

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing projects with custom `typewriterFocusLines` settings are preserved
- Users can revert to old behavior by setting `typewriterFocusLines: 2`
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Usage Instructions

### Enable Enhanced Focus Mode
1. Open any file: `writers edit filename`
2. Press `F9` to enable typewriter mode
3. Press `i` to enter insert mode
4. Experience the enhanced focus with minimal distractions

### Customize Focus Window
Edit your project's `writers.config.json`:
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "editor": {
      "typewriterMode": true,
      "typewriterFocusLines": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Configurable dimming colors/intensity
- Smooth dimming transitions
- Sentence-level focus options
- Integration with writing goals

### User Feedback Areas
- Optimal focus window size for different use cases
- Dimming intensity preferences
- Terminal compatibility across different themes

## Conclusion

These changes transform the typewriter mode into a more focused writing tool that minimizes distractions while maintaining essential context. The enhanced dimming and reduced focus window create a natural spotlight effect that helps writers maintain concentration on their current work.

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility while providing a significantly improved default experience for new users. Writers can still customize the focus window size based on their personal preferences and writing style.
