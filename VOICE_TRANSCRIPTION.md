- **Speak clearly** - Moderate pace, clear pronunciation
- **Stay close to microphone** - 6-12 inches is optimal
- **Avoid echo** - Soft furnishings help reduce echo

### File Formats

- **WAV files** provide the best transcription accuracy
- **16kHz sample rate** is optimal for speech recognition
- **Mono recording** is sufficient for speech
- **Compress files** using MP3/M4A for storage

### Integration Workflow

1. **Voice Brainstorming** - Record ideas quickly during inspiration
2. **Interview Transcription** - Convert interviews to text for analysis
3. **Story Dictation** - Speak your stories directly into text
4. **Note Taking** - Capture meeting notes hands-free
5. **Draft Creation** - Create first drafts through dictation

## Configuration

### Settings File

Voice transcription settings are stored in your `writers.config.json`:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "maxDuration": 300,
    "keepAudio": false,
    "autoSave": true,
    "outputFormat": "markdown",
    "modelSize": "tiny"
  }
}
```

### Model Sizes

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| tiny | 39MB | Fastest | Good | Quick notes |
| base | 74MB | Fast | Better | General use |
| small | 244MB | Medium | Great | High quality |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No microphone detected:**
- Check microphone permissions
- Restart the application
- Try a different microphone

**Poor transcription quality:**
- Reduce background noise
- Speak more clearly
- Check microphone positioning
- Try a different audio format

**Model download fails:**
- Check internet connection
- Clear cache: `rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface`
- Try manual download

**Recording won't start:**
- Check microphone permissions
- Close other applications using microphone
- Restart system audio service

### System Requirements

- **Node.js** 14.0 or higher
- **Available RAM** 2GB minimum (4GB recommended)
- **Disk Space** 1GB for models and temporary files
- **Microphone** Any USB or built-in microphone

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflows

Create custom workflows combining voice transcription with other Writers CLI features:

```bash
# Voice note ‚Üí Story creation
writers voice record "idea.md"
writers new shortstory "My New Story" --template idea.md

# Interview ‚Üí Character development
writers voice transcribe interview.wav -o character-notes.md
writers new character "John Doe" --notes character-notes.md
```

### Automation Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily voice journal
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
writers voice record "journal-$DATE.md"
```

### Integration with Text Editors

The transcribed text works seamlessly with:
- **Built-in editor** (`writers write`)
- **External editors** (VS Code, Vim, etc.)
- **Word processors** (via Markdown export)

## API Integration

For developers wanting to integrate voice transcription:

```javascript
const VoiceTranscriber = require('writers-cli/src/voice/transcriber');

const transcriber = new VoiceTranscriber();
await transcriber.initialize();

// Record and transcribe
const result = await transcriber.recordAndTranscribe();
console.log(result.text);

// Transcribe file
const text = await transcriber.transcribeFile('audio.wav');
console.log(text);
```

## Privacy & Security

- **100% Offline** - No data sent to external servers
- **Local Processing** - All transcription happens on your device
- **No Cloud Dependencies** - Works without internet after setup
- **Secure Storage** - Transcriptions saved locally only
- **Open Source** - Built on open-source Whisper model

## Performance Optimization

### For Better Speed:
- Use smaller model sizes (tiny/base)
- Record shorter segments
- Use WAV format for processing
- Close unnecessary applications

### For Better Accuracy:
- Use larger model sizes (small/medium)
- High-quality audio input
- Minimize background noise
- Clear speech patterns

## Future Roadmap

- **Speaker Recognition** - Identify different speakers
- **Punctuation Enhancement** - Better automatic punctuation
- **Custom Vocabularies** - Add domain-specific terms
- **Real-time Streaming** - Live transcription display
- **Multiple Languages** - Support for non-English languages
