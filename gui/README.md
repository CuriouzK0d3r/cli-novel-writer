## Tips for Maximum Productivity

### Keyboard-First Workflow

- Use `Ctrl+F` to quickly find text instead of scrolling
- `Ctrl+G` lets you jump to specific lines for quick navigation

### Auto-save Benefits

- The status bar shows save state with visual indicators
- You can still manually save with `Ctrl+S` for important milestones

### Statistics Tracking
- Press `Ctrl+W` anytime to see detailed writing statistics
- Track word count, reading time, and document structure
- Use this for setting and meeting daily writing goals

### Search and Replace
- `Ctrl+F` for simple text search with next/previous buttons
- `Ctrl+R` for powerful find and replace operations
- Use "Replace All" for bulk changes across your entire document

## Compatibility

### File Formats
- Plain text (.txt)
- Markdown (.md, .markdown)
- All file formats supported by the CLI version

### Cross-Platform
- Windows: Full support with native file dialogs
- macOS: Native menu bar integration
- Linux: GTK-based file dialogs

### CLI Integration
- Files created in GUI work seamlessly with CLI commands
- Project structure remains compatible
- All Writers CLI features remain accessible via command line

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Start
```bash
# Check if Electron is installed
npm list electron

# Reinstall if needed
npm install electron

# Try alternative launch method
npm run gui
```

### Performance Issues
- Close other applications to free up memory
- Restart the GUI if editing very large files
- Use the CLI editor for files over 1MB

### Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working
- Make sure the editor area has focus (click in the text area)
- On macOS, some shortcuts use Cmd instead of Ctrl
- Check that no other applications are intercepting the shortcuts

## Development

### Architecture
- **Main Process**: `gui/main.js` - Electron main process, handles menus and file operations
- **Renderer Process**: `gui/renderer.html` + `gui/renderer.js` - UI and editor logic
- **Shared Logic**: Reuses existing editor utilities from `src/editor/`

### Customization
- Modify `gui/renderer.html` for UI changes
- Update `gui/renderer.js` for editor behavior
- Adjust `gui/main.js` for menu items and shortcuts

## Support

For issues, questions, or feature requests:
1. Check the main Writers CLI documentation
2. Use `F1` in the GUI for keyboard shortcut reference
3. Try the CLI version to isolate GUI-specific issues
4. Report bugs with steps to reproduce
