# Pomodoro Timer Feature

The Writers CLI editor now includes a built-in Pomodoro timer to help you maintain focused writing sessions and improve productivity.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique helps:

- **Maintain focus** - Dedicated work periods with clear boundaries
- **Prevent burnout** - Regular breaks to rest and recharge
- **Track progress** - Count completed sessions to measure productivity
- **Build consistency** - Establish a sustainable writing routine

## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Open any story**: `writers write your-story`
2. **Start timer**: Press `F3` to begin your first Pomodoro session
3. **Write focused**: The timer shows in your status bar - just write!
4. **Take breaks**: When the session ends, you'll get a notification for break time
5. **Repeat**: The timer automatically cycles between work and break periods

### Timer Controls

### Status Bar Display

## Writing Tips with Pomodoro

### Before Starting

1. **Plan your session** - Know what you want to write
2. **Eliminate distractions** - Close other apps, silence notifications
3. **Set a specific goal** - "Write 500 words" or "Complete this scene"

### During Work Sessions

- **Stay focused** - Resist the urge to check email/social media
- **Keep writing** - Don't edit heavily, just get words down
- **Use the status bar** - Glance at remaining time for motivation
- **Note ideas quickly** - Use `Ctrl+T` to toggle to notes for quick thoughts

### During Breaks

- **Step away** from the computer
- **Move your body** - Stretch, walk, do jumping jacks
- **Rest your eyes** - Look at something distant
- **Hydrate** - Keep water nearby

### Session Planning

- **Start small** - Begin with 1-2 Pomodoros if you're new
- **Build gradually** - Work up to longer writing sessions
- **Track patterns** - Notice when you're most productive
- **Adjust timing** - Some writers prefer 45-minute sessions

## Customization

While the current implementation uses standard Pomodoro timing (25/5/15 minutes), the timer is designed to be configurable. Future updates may include:

- Custom work/break durations
- Different timing profiles (e.g., 45/10/20 for deep work)
- Daily/weekly Pomodoro tracking
- Integration with writing goals
- Sound notifications (optional)

## Best Practices

### Getting Started

1. **Try it once** - Start with a single Pomodoro to get familiar
2. **Use with existing workflow** - Don't change everything at once
3. **Track what works** - Notice which times of day are most productive

### Advanced Usage

- **Batch similar tasks** - Use Pomodoros for editing vs. drafting
- **Plan daily goals** - "I want to complete 4 Pomodoros today"
- **Combine with word goals** - "500 words per Pomodoro"
- **Review progress** - Check Pomodoro count at end of sessions

### Troubleshooting

- **Interruptions**: Pause timer, handle interruption, resume when ready
- **Can't focus**: Try shorter sessions or check if you need a longer break
- **Too rigid**: It's okay to adjust - the timer serves you, not the other way around
