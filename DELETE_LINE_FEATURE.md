# Delete Line Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a new keyboard shortcut to delete the current line in the Writers CLI Editor. This feature enhances the editing experience by providing a quick way to remove unwanted lines during writing and editing using the Vim-style "dd" command.

## Implementation Details

### New Function: `deleteLine()`
**Location:** `src/editor/buffer-editor.js` (lines 758-792)

**Functionality:**
- Deletes the current line where the cursor is positioned
- Handles edge cases (single line, empty files)
- Maintains cursor position intelligently
- Integrates with the existing undo/redo system
- Marks the file as dirty for auto-save

**Key Features:**
- If only one line exists and it's empty, does nothing
- If only one line exists with content, clears it but keeps the line
- For multiple lines, removes the current line and adjusts cursor position
- Ensures cursor X position stays within bounds of the new current line
- Maintains proper editor state (undo, dirty flag, rendering)

### Keyboard Shortcut
**Shortcut:** `dd` (press 'd' twice quickly)
**Location:** `src/editor/buffer-editor.js` (lines 315-342)

**Implementation:**
- Sequence detection with 500ms timeout
- Only works in navigation mode
- Falls back to normal 'd' behavior (right movement) if sequence not completed

**Availability:** Navigation mode only (not insert mode)

### Documentation Update
**Location:** `src/editor/dialogs.js` (line 563)

Added to the help dialog under "Edit Operations":
```
dd             Delete current line (navigation mode)
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Ensure navigation mode:** Make sure you're in navigation mode (NAV in status bar)
2. **Navigate to target line:** Use arrow keys, j/k, or any movement command
3. **Delete the line:** Press `dd` (d twice quickly within 500ms)
4. **Undo if needed:** Press `Ctrl+Z` to restore the deleted line

**Note:** The `dd` shortcut only works in navigation mode, not insert mode.

## Technical Behavior

### Normal Operation
- Removes the line at cursor position
- Adjusts cursor Y position if at end of document
- Clamps cursor X position to fit within the new current line
- Triggers undo checkpoint before deletion
- Updates editor display and status

### Edge Cases Handled
- **Single empty line:** No action taken
- **Single line with content:** Line is cleared but preserved
- **Cursor at last line:** Cursor moves to new last line
- **Cursor X beyond new line length:** Cursor X clamped to line end

### Integration Points
- **Undo System:** Full integration with `pushUndo()`
- **File State:** Marks file as dirty via `markDirty()`
- **Display:** Updates rendering and cursor visibility
- **Status Bar:** Refreshes status information

## Testing

### Test Scripts
1. **`test-delete-line.js`** - Interactive test with sample content
2. **`demo-delete-line.js`** - Feature demonstration with instructions
3. **`test-dd-auto.js`** - Automated unit tests for dd functionality
4. **`verify-dd.js`** - Interactive verification of dd sequence detection
5. **`test-dd-simple.txt`** - Simple test file for manual testing

### Test Scenarios
- DD sequence detection and timing
- Delete lines in multi-line documents
- Delete single line in document
- Delete with cursor at various positions
- Undo/redo operations
- Navigation mode requirement
- Timeout handling for incomplete sequences
- Fallback to normal 'd' key behavior

## Files Modified

1. **`src/editor/buffer-editor.js`**
   - Added `deleteLine()` method (lines 758-792)
   - Added dd sequence tracking variables (lines 84-88)
   - Added dd sequence detection logic (lines 315-342)

2. **`src/editor/dialogs.js`**
   - Updated help dialog text (line 563)

3. **New test files:**
   - `test-delete-line.js` - Interactive testing script
   - `demo-delete-line.js` - Demo and feature showcase
   - `test-dd-auto.js` - Automated unit tests
   - `verify-dd.js` - DD sequence verification
   - `test-dd-simple.txt` - Manual testing file

## Compatibility

- **Modes:** Works in navigation mode only (by design for safety)
- **Themes:** Compatible with all existing themes
- **Platforms:** Cross-platform (uses blessed.js key handling)
- **Existing Features:** Integrates with 'd' key (right movement) without conflicts
- **Vim Users:** Familiar dd command for line deletion

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- `yy` for duplicate line (Vim-style)
- `Alt+Up/Down` for move line up/down
- `d3d` or `3dd` for multiple line deletion
- `dw` for delete word
- Delete line with specific patterns (empty lines, etc.)
- Configurable timeout for dd sequence

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal:** Single array splice operation
- **Memory:** Leverages existing undo system
- **Rendering:** Standard render cycle, no additional overhead

## User Experience

The delete line feature follows Vim editor conventions:
- **Familiar shortcut:** `dd` is the standard Vim command for line deletion
- **Mode-aware:** Only works in navigation mode for safety
- **Predictable behavior:** Matches Vim user expectations
- **Quick and efficient:** Double-tap sequence for fast line removal
- **Recoverable:** Full undo support maintains user confidence
- **Documented:** Included in F1 help dialog for discoverability
- **Fallback behavior:** Single 'd' still works for right movement
