## Core Principles

Crystal magic is based on the manipulation of natural energy that flows through special crystalline formations found throughout the realm.

### Types of Crystals
- **Healing Crystals** (Green): Accelerate natural healing and purification
- **Light Crystals** (White/Gold): Create barriers, weapons, and illumination
- **Mind Crystals** (Blue): Enable telepathy and mental shields
- **Earth Crystals** (Brown): Control over stone, metal, and growing things
- **Void Crystals** (Black): Forbidden crystals that drain energy and life

### Crystalwright Abilities
1. **Sight**: Can see magical energy flows
2. **Touch**: Direct manipulation of crystal energy
3. **Channeling**: Focus crystal power through tools or weapons
4. **Resonance**: Advanced users can connect with multiple crystals simultaneously

### Limitations
- Requires physical contact or close proximity to crystals
- Overuse causes exhaustion and potential magical burnout
- Void crystals corrupt users over time
- Natural talent varies greatly between individuals

### The Great Purge
Fifty years ago, Lord Malachar began systematically destroying crystal formations and hunting Crystalwrights, leading to the near-extinction of crystal magic.
