Lyra sat by her grandmother's fireplace, the mysterious crystal warm in her palm, when a knock came at the door. But it wasn't an ordinary knock—each rap seemed to resonate with the crystal's energy.

"Grandmother," Lyra called, but received no answer. The old woman had gone to the market and wouldn't return for hours.

Another knock, more insistent this time. Against her better judgment, Lyra approached the door.

"Who's there?"

"Someone who knows what you're holding, child," came a gravelly voice. "And someone who can teach you to use it before the Void Hunters find you."

Lyra's blood turned to ice. She'd heard whispers of the Void Hunters—shadow creatures that served the Dark Lord, hunting down anyone with magical abilities.

"How do I know you're not one of them?"

A soft chuckle answered her. "Because, my dear, I'm about to do something no Void Hunter ever could."

The crystal in her hand suddenly blazed with warm, golden light, and through the door's wooden panels, she could see a figure outlined in the same gentle radiance.

With trembling fingers, she opened the door to reveal an elderly man with kind eyes and robes that seemed to shimmer between brown and silver.

"My name is Thaddeus Starweaver," he said with a bow. "Last of the old Crystalwright order, and if you'll have me, your teacher."

He glanced at the horizon where dark clouds were gathering unnaturally fast. "But we must hurry. They're coming, and you have much to learn."

Thus began Lyra's true education in the ancient arts, though neither she nor Thaddeus could foresee the incredible journey that lay ahead.
