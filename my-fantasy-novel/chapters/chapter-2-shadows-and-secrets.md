## Content

Three hundred miles away in the obsidian towers of Shadowhaven, Lord Malachar felt the disturbance like a knife through his meditation.

Someone had awakened. After fifty years of silence, crystal magic had stirred once again in the realm.

"My lord," his lieutenant, Captain Vex, entered the chamber with the deference of one who knew the price of disrespect. "The scrying orbs have detected magical resonance from the eastern provinces."

Malachar's pale eyes opened, glowing with malevolent energy. "How many?"

"Just one, my lord. A single awakening, somewhere near Millbrook."

A smile crept across the Dark Lord's face, cold as winter's bite. "Then our long wait comes to an end. Send the Void Hunters. Find this new Crystalwright before they fully understand their power."

He rose from his meditation cushion, dark robes flowing around him like liquid shadow. "And Captain? Make sure they understand the consequences of resistance. We cannot afford another uprising."

As Vex bowed and departed, Malachar gazed out at the storm clouds gathering over his fortress. Soon, very soon, his vision of a world without crystal magic would be complete.

But first, he had to eliminate this new threat before it could grow into something more dangerous.
