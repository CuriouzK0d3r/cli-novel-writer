<p>The morning mist clung to the Whispering Woods like secrets waiting to be told. Lyra Moonweaver had walked this path a thousand times before, gathering herbs for her grandmother&#39;s apothecary, but today something felt different.</p>
<p>As she knelt beside a cluster of silverleaf, her fingers brushed against something cold and smooth beneath the moss. A crystal, no larger than her thumb, pulsed with an inner light that seemed to respond to her touch.</p>
<p>&quot;Impossible,&quot; she whispered, but the crystal&#39;s glow only grew brighter.</p>
<p>The moment her skin made contact with its surface, the world exploded into color. Every living thing around her—the trees, the flowers, even the tiny insects—radiated streams of light visible only to her newly awakened sight.</p>
<p>She was a Crystalwright, one of the legendary magic users her grandmother had told her stories about. The very people who had vanished from the realm fifty years ago.</p>
<p>But if she could see the crystal magic, that meant the old legends were true. The Dark Convergence was coming, and the realm would need its Crystalwrights more than ever.</p>
<p>Little did Lyra know that in the capital city, shadows were already moving, and her discovery had not gone unnoticed.</p>

<p>Three hundred miles away in the obsidian towers of Shadowhaven, Lord Malachar felt the disturbance like a knife through his meditation.</p>
<p>Someone had awakened. After fifty years of silence, crystal magic had stirred once again in the realm.</p>
<p>&quot;My lord,&quot; his lieutenant, Captain Vex, entered the chamber with the deference of one who knew the price of disrespect. &quot;The scrying orbs have detected magical resonance from the eastern provinces.&quot;</p>
<p>Malachar&#39;s pale eyes opened, glowing with malevolent energy. &quot;How many?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just one, my lord. A single awakening, somewhere near Millbrook.&quot;</p>
<p>A smile crept across the Dark Lord&#39;s face, cold as winter&#39;s bite. &quot;Then our long wait comes to an end. Send the Void Hunters. Find this new Crystalwright before they fully understand their power.&quot;</p>
<p>He rose from his meditation cushion, dark robes flowing around him like liquid shadow. &quot;And Captain? Make sure they understand the consequences of resistance. We cannot afford another uprising.&quot;</p>
<p>As Vex bowed and departed, Malachar gazed out at the storm clouds gathering over his fortress. Soon, very soon, his vision of a world without crystal magic would be complete.</p>
<p>But first, he had to eliminate this new threat before it could grow into something more dangerous.</p>

<p>Lyra sat by her grandmother&#39;s fireplace, the mysterious crystal warm in her palm, when a knock came at the door. But it wasn&#39;t an ordinary knock—each rap seemed to resonate with the crystal&#39;s energy.</p>
<p>&quot;Grandmother,&quot; Lyra called, but received no answer. The old woman had gone to the market and wouldn&#39;t return for hours.</p>
<p>Another knock, more insistent this time. Against her better judgment, Lyra approached the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Someone who knows what you&#39;re holding, child,&quot; came a gravelly voice. &quot;And someone who can teach you to use it before the Void Hunters find you.&quot;</p>
<p>Lyra&#39;s blood turned to ice. She&#39;d heard whispers of the Void Hunters—shadow creatures that served the Dark Lord, hunting down anyone with magical abilities.</p>
<p>&quot;How do I know you&#39;re not one of them?&quot;</p>
<p>A soft chuckle answered her. &quot;Because, my dear, I&#39;m about to do something no Void Hunter ever could.&quot;</p>
<p>The crystal in her hand suddenly blazed with warm, golden light, and through the door&#39;s wooden panels, she could see a figure outlined in the same gentle radiance.</p>
<p>With trembling fingers, she opened the door to reveal an elderly man with kind eyes and robes that seemed to shimmer between brown and silver.</p>
<p>&quot;My name is Thaddeus Starweaver,&quot; he said with a bow. &quot;Last of the old Crystalwright order, and if you&#39;ll have me, your teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>He glanced at the horizon where dark clouds were gathering unnaturally fast. &quot;But we must hurry. They&#39;re coming, and you have much to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus began Lyra&#39;s true education in the ancient arts, though neither she nor Thaddeus could foresee the incredible journey that lay ahead.</p>
