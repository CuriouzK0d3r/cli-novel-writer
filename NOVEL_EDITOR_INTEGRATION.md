# Novel Editor Integration

This document describes the integration of the "novel-editor" option into the Writers CLI project initialization and writing workflow.

## Overview

The Writers CLI now includes "Novel Editor" as the default and primary editor option when initializing new projects and opening files for editing. This provides users with a seamless, writer-focused editing experience right out of the box.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Initialization (`src/commands/init.js`)

**Updated Editor Selection:**
- Added "Novel Editor (built-in, writer-focused)" as the first option
- Set `novel-editor` as the default choice (previously `nano`)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing editor options

**Available Options:**
1. **Novel Editor (built-in, writer-focused)** ‚≠ê *Default*
2. Nano (simple, built-in)
3. Vim (advanced)
4. VS Code (if installed)
5. System default

### 2. Write Command (`src/commands/write.js`)

**Enhanced Editor Handling:**
- Updated prompt text to show "Novel Editor" instead of "Writers Editor"
- Added support for both `novel-editor` and `writers-editor` values for backward compatibility
- Set `novel-editor` as the default choice in interactive prompts

**Launch Messages:**
- Updated console output to display "üöÄ Launching Novel Editor..."
- Improved user feedback during editor startup

### 3. Editor Interface Updates

**Screen Title:**
- Changed window title from "Writers Editor" to "Novel Editor"
- Updated in `src/editor/buffer-editor.js`

**Help Documentation:**
- Updated help dialog title to "Novel Editor Help"
- Changed help content headers to reference "Novel Editor"
- Updated in `src/editor/dialogs.js` and `src/editor/text-buffer.js`

**Demo Application:**
- Updated demo script titles and messages
- Changed from "Writers Editor Demo" to "Novel Editor Demo"
- Updated in `demo-editor.js`

### 4. Command Line Interface

**Help Text Updates:**
- Updated write command help to include `novel-editor` option
- Modified option description: "Preferred editor (novel-editor, nano, vim, code)"
- Updated in `bin/writers.js`

## Cursor Mode Integration

The novel-editor includes enhanced cursor modes for better modal editing experience:

### Navigation Mode (NAV)
- **Cursor Style:** Block cursor (solid rectangle)
- **Purpose:** File navigation and text manipulation
- **Activation:** Default mode, or press `Escape`

### Insert Mode (INS)
- **Cursor Style:** Line cursor (vertical bar `|`)
- **Purpose:** Text input and editing
- **Activation:** Press `i` from navigation mode

### Visual Indicators
- Status bar shows current mode: "NAV" or "INS"
- Cursor style automatically changes based on mode
- Consistent blinking behavior across both modes

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:

### Configuration Files
- Existing `writers.config.json` files with `defaultEditor: 'nano'` continue to work
- Projects can still be configured to use any supported editor
- Settings are preserved during project updates

### Command Line Usage
- All existing command line options continue to function
- `writers write --editor nano` still works as expected
- Users can override the default editor choice at any time

### Legacy Editor Values
- Code still recognizes `writers-editor` value for existing configurations
- Automatic fallback handles both `novel-editor` and `writers-editor` identically

## User Experience

### New Project Flow
1. Run `writers init`
2. Answer project setup questions
3. **Novel Editor is pre-selected as default**
4. Complete initialization with optimal editor configured

### Writing Flow
1. Run `writers write [file]`
2. If no editor configured, **Novel Editor is offered first**
3. Editor launches with modal editing and cursor modes
4. Enhanced writing experience with writer-focused features

### Editor Features
- **Modal editing:** Navigation and insert modes
- **Visual cursor feedback:** Block vs line cursor
- **Writer-focused UI:** Clean, distraction-free interface
- **Markdown support:** Syntax highlighting and formatting
- **Real-time statistics:** Word count, reading time, progress tracking

## Migration Guide

### For New Users
- No action required - Novel Editor is the default choice
- Follow standard `writers init` workflow
- Enjoy enhanced editing experience out of the box

### For Existing Users
- Current projects continue to use configured editor
- To switch to Novel Editor:
  1. Edit `writers.config.json`
  2. Set `"defaultEditor": "novel-editor"`
  3. Or use `writers write --editor novel-editor`

### For Developers
- Import paths remain unchanged: `require('./src/editor')`
- API compatibility maintained for programmatic usage
- All existing editor methods and events work identically

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- `test-init-options.js` - Verifies novel-editor appears in init prompts
- `test-cursor-modes.js` - Tests cursor mode switching functionality
- All existing tests continue to pass

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test initialization
writers init

# Test writing workflow  
writers write [file]

# Test cursor modes
node test-cursor-modes.js

# Test option verification
node test-init-options.js
```

## Benefits

### For Writers
- **Seamless experience:** No need to configure external editors
- **Writer-focused features:** Built specifically for novel writing
- **Modal editing:** Efficient navigation and editing workflow
- **Visual feedback:** Clear indication of current editing mode

### For the Project
- **Better onboarding:** New users get optimal experience immediately
- **Feature showcase:** Highlights the custom editor capabilities
- **Reduced friction:** Eliminates need to install/configure external editors
- **Professional appearance:** Branded "Novel Editor" emphasizes purpose

## Technical Notes

### Implementation Details
- Editor class remains `WritersEditor` internally for code consistency
- Display names updated to "Novel Editor" for user-facing text
- Configuration values use `novel-editor` string identifier
- Backward compatibility maintained through value mapping

### Performance Impact
- No performance changes - same underlying editor implementation
- Only cosmetic and configuration changes
- Memory footprint unchanged

### Future Considerations
- Additional editor themes and customization options
- Enhanced modal editing features
- Integration with more writing-specific tools
- Possible plugin system for editor extensions

*This integration makes the Writers CLI more user-friendly by defaulting to the purpose-built Novel Editor while maintaining full flexibility for users who prefer other editing tools.*
