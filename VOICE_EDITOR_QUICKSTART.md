## üéØ Voice Dictation Tips

### Speaking Best Practices

- **Use natural speech patterns** - AI handles punctuation

### Positioning Your Cursor
- Place cursor **exactly where** you want text inserted
- Voice text appears **at cursor position** by default
- You can change insert mode in settings (cursor/append/replace)

### Sample Dictation Session

1. **Position cursor** in your document
2. **Activate voice** (Ctrl+Shift+V or click button)
3. **Speak naturally**: *"Sarah walked through the misty forest, her footsteps echoing in the silence. She had never felt more alone."*
4. **Review** the transcribed text
5. **Insert** into your document

## ‚öôÔ∏è Voice Settings

Click the **gear icon** in the voice popup to configure:

| Setting | Options | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Auto-insert** | On/Off | Off (for review) |
| **Insert Mode** | Cursor/Append/Replace | Cursor |
| **Language** | Multiple supported | Your native language |
| **Visualizer** | Show/Hide | Show (helpful feedback) |
| **Auto-save** | On/Off | On (saves after insert) |

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working
- **Check browser permissions** (usually shows in address bar)
- **Test system microphone** in other applications
- **Refresh page** and grant permissions when prompted

### Poor Transcription Quality
- **Reduce background noise** (close windows, turn off fans)

- **Check language setting** matches your speech
- **Speak at moderate pace** (not too fast/slow)

### Voice Button Missing
