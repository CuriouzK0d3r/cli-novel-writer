## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Structure
The GUI maintains the same file structure as the CLI:
```
project/
├── chapters/          # Main story chapters
├── scenes/           # Individual scenes
├── characters/       # Character profiles
├── shortstories/     # Complete short stories
├── notes/           # Research and notes
├── exports/         # Exported files
└── writers.config.json # Project configuration
```

### Data Storage
- All content is stored as Markdown files
- Project settings are saved in `writers.config.json`
- Statistics are calculated in real-time from file content
- No external database required

### Performance
