# Typewriter Mode Test Document

This is a test document to verify that typewriter mode is working correctly in the Writers CLI GUI editor.

2. Enable typewriter mode by clicking the "Typewriter: OFF" button in the editor toolbar
3. Click anywhere in this document to position your cursor
4. Type or navigate using arrow keys
5. The current line should stay centered in the editor view

## Expected Behavior

When typewriter mode is enabled:
- The current line should remain centered vertically in the editor

- The scrolling should be smooth and responsive
- The typewriter indicator should be visible in the editor info bar

Test by placing your cursor on different lines and observing the centering behavior.
