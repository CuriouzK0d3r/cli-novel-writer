# Focused Typewriter Mode Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the focused typewriter mode feature implementation, which enhances the existing typewriter mode with a dimming effect that creates a distraction-free writing environment.

## Overview

The focused typewriter mode builds upon the existing typewriter functionality by adding a "focus window" that keeps only the current line and a configurable number of surrounding lines at full brightness, while dimming all other content. This creates a natural spotlight effect that helps writers maintain concentration on their current work.

## Key Features

### Visual Focus Window
- Shows current line + configurable lines before/after at full brightness
- Dims all other lines using dark gray color coding
- Default window size: current line ± 1 line (3 total visible lines)
- Focus window moves smoothly with cursor navigation

### Smart Dimming Logic
- Only active when typewriter mode is enabled (F9)
- Uses blessed markup `{#333333-fg}...{/}` for dimming effect
- Preserves cursor visibility even in dimmed areas
- Works with both line numbers and plain text modes

### Configurable Behavior
- `typewriterFocusLines` setting controls window size
- Default: 1 line before/after cursor
- Saved in project configuration (`writers.config.json`)
- Can be customized per project

## Implementation Details

### Core Files Modified

#### `src/editor/buffer-editor.js`
- Added `typewriterFocusLines` property and configuration
- Modified `render()` method to apply dimming logic
- Updated `toggleTypewriterMode()` to save focus configuration
- Enhanced cursor rendering to work with dimmed lines

#### Documentation Updates
- Updated `TYPEWRITER_MODE.md` with focused window documentation
- Enhanced `README-WRITERS-CLI.md` feature descriptions
- Updated help dialog in `src/editor/dialogs.js`

### Technical Implementation

#### Dimming Logic
```javascript
const shouldDimLine = this.typewriterMode &&
  (lineIndex < this.cursorY - this.typewriterFocusLines ||
   lineIndex > this.cursorY + this.typewriterFocusLines);

if (shouldDimLine) {
  lineContent = `{#333333-fg}${lineContent}{/}`;
}
```

#### Cursor Handling in Dimmed Areas
The implementation carefully preserves cursor visibility by:
- Removing dimming tags around cursor position
- Applying cursor styling (inverse for navigation, | for insert)
- Re-applying dimming around the cursor

#### Configuration Loading
```javascript
// Load from project configuration
this.typewriterFocusLines = 
  config.settings?.editor?.typewriterFocusLines ||
  this.config.typewriterFocusLines || 1;
```

## User Experience

### Visual Behavior
1. **Normal Mode**: All text appears at full brightness
2. **Typewriter Mode Enabled**: 
   - Current line and ±1 line appear bright
   - All other lines appear dimmed (dark gray)
   - Focus window follows cursor movement
   - Smooth transitions as user navigates

### Keyboard Controls
- **F9**: Toggle typewriter mode on/off
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate and watch focus window move
- **i**: Enter insert mode for typing
- **Escape**: Return to navigation mode

### Configuration Options
- `typewriterFocusLines`: Number of lines before/after cursor to keep bright
- Automatically saved to project settings
- Persists across editing sessions

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (`test-focused-window.js`)
- Focus window positioning at various cursor locations
- Edge case handling (near document start/end)
- Dimming application correctness
- Custom configuration respect
- Mode toggle functionality

### Interactive Tests
- `test-focused-typewriter.js`: Manual testing script
- `focused-typewriter-demo.txt`: Comprehensive demo file
- Integration with existing typewriter tests

## Benefits for Writers

### Enhanced Concentration
- Reduces visual distractions from completed content
- Creates natural focus on current work area
- Maintains writing flow without manual scrolling

### Improved Writing Experience
- Combines typewriter centering with focus enhancement
- Preserves minimal context (±1 line) while reducing noise
- Smooth, non-disruptive visual transitions

### Flexible Usage
- Works for both writing new content and editing
- Toggle on/off based on writing vs. reviewing needs
- Configurable focus window size for personal preference

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Minimal overhead when disabled
- Efficient string manipulation for dimming
- No impact on existing editor functionality

### Compatibility
- Preserves all existing typewriter mode features
- Works with distraction-free mode (F11)
- Compatible with line numbers and cursor styles
- Maintains terminal color compatibility

### Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Well-documented configuration options
- Backward compatible implementation

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "editor": {
      "typewriterMode": true,
      "typewriterFocusLines": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage
1. Open any file with `writers edit filename`
2. Press F9 to enable focused typewriter mode
3. Press 'i' to enter insert mode
4. Start writing and observe the focus window effect

### Customization
- Modify `typewriterFocusLines` in project configuration
- Values 0-3 recommended for optimal experience
- Larger values reduce dimming effect

### Best Practices
- Use with dark terminal themes for better contrast
- Combine with distraction-free mode (F11) for maximum focus
- Toggle off when reviewing or heavily editing existing content

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Improvements
- Smooth dimming transitions/animations
- User-configurable dimming color/intensity
- Multiple focus window presets
- Integration with word count goals
- Custom keybindings for focus adjustment

### Advanced Features
- Sentence-level focus (instead of line-level)
- Paragraph-aware focus windows
- Integration with document structure (headings, etc.)
- Time-based auto-dimming of completed sections

## Conclusion

The focused typewriter mode implementation successfully enhances the writing experience by creating a natural spotlight effect around the cursor. The feature is well-integrated with existing functionality, thoroughly tested, and provides meaningful value for focused writing sessions.

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding significant value for writers who want to minimize distractions and maintain concentration during creative sessions. The configurable nature allows users to customize the experience to their personal preferences and writing style.
