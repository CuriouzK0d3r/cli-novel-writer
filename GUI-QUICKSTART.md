## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Start
```bash
# Check if Electron is installed
npm list electron

# Install if missing
npm install electron --save-dev

# Try launching again
npm run gui
```

### Project Creation Fails
- Ensure project name doesn't contain special characters
- Check you have write permissions to Documents folder
- Try a different project name if one already exists

### Can't Find Existing Project
- Make sure the folder contains `writers.config.json`
- Navigate to the correct project directory
- Look for folders in `~/Documents/` created by Writers CLI

## 📋 Project Structure

When you create a new project, Writers CLI automatically creates:

```
~/Documents/YourProjectName/
├── writers.config.json       # Project configuration
├── README.md                # Project overview
├── chapters/                # Main content chapters
├── scenes/                  # Individual scenes
├── characters/              # Character development
├── notes/                   # Research and ideas
├── drafts/                  # Draft versions
└── exports/                 # Published/exported content
```

## 🔄 Switching Between Projects

To work on a different project:
1. Click "Back to Welcome" (if available)
2. Or restart the GUI
3. Use "Open Existing Project" to switch

## 🐛 Debug Mode

For troubleshooting, you can run in debug mode:

```bash
# Debug mode with console output
npm run gui-debug
```

This shows detailed logging information in the terminal.

## 📚 What's Next?

After creating or opening a project:
1. The project interface loads with your project information
2. You can start writing immediately
3. Access additional features through the project interface
4. Your work is automatically organized in the project structure

## 🔧 Advanced Options

### Restore Original GUI
If you ever need to revert to the original interface:

```bash
node restore-gui.js
```

### Re-apply the Fix
If something goes wrong, re-run the fix:

```bash
node fix-gui.js
```

## 🎉 Success!

You now have a fully working Writers CLI GUI that:
- ✅ Shows a clear welcome screen
- ✅ Creates projects reliably
