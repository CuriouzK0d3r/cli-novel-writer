# Typewriter Mode Demo

This is a sample text file to demonstrate the typewriter mode feature in the Writers CLI editor.

## What is Typewriter Mode?

Typewriter mode keeps your current line of text centered (or positioned at 2/3 down the screen) as you type, similar to how a physical typewriter works where the paper moves up as you type new lines.

## How to Test

1. Open this file in the editor: `writers edit typewriter-demo.txt`
2. Press F9 to toggle typewriter mode ON
3. Press 'i' to enter insert mode
4. Position your cursor at the end of this document
5. Start typing new lines and watch how the text scrolls

## Sample Content for Testing

Line 1: This is the first line of sample content.
Line 2: Notice how when you add new lines below...
Line 3: The cursor should stay in the same position on screen...
Line 4: While the text above scrolls up automatically.
Line 5: This creates a focused writing experience.
Line 6: Perfect for long writing sessions.
Line 7: No need to manually scroll to keep your work visible.
Line 8: Just keep typing and let the editor handle the rest.
Line 9: You can toggle typewriter mode on and off with F9.
Line 10: Try switching between normal and typewriter modes.
