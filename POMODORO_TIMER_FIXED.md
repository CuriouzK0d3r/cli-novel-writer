# 🍅 Pomodoro Timer - FIXED & WORKING

The Pomodoro timer in the Writers CLI editor has been **completely fixed** and is now fully functional. Here's everything you need to know about the fix and how to use it.

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

The issue was **NOT** with the timer logic itself, but with **keybinding compatibility** and **missing theme support**:

### 1. Keybinding Issues
- **F3 key not working**: Some terminals don't support F3 or intercept it for their own use
- **Environment compatibility**: The blessed.js keybinding system wasn't receiving F3 events in certain environments

### 2. Theme Support Issues  
- **Light Theme**: Missing pomodoro display logic entirely
- **Base Theme**: No status bar method with pomodoro support
- **Fallback handling**: Theme manager lacked pomodoro support in fallback scenarios

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Alternative Keybindings Added**
```
PRIMARY CONTROLS:
F3             🍅 Start/pause timer
F4             📊 Show timer details  
Shift+F3       🔄 Reset timer

ALTERNATIVE CONTROLS (if F3 doesn't work):
Ctrl+P         🍅 Start/pause timer
Ctrl+Shift+P   📊 Show timer details
Ctrl+R         🔄 Reset timer
```

### 2. **Complete Theme Support**
- ✅ **Dark Theme**: Full pomodoro support (already working)
- ✅ **Light Theme**: Added complete pomodoro display logic
- ✅ **Base Theme**: Added status bar method with pomodoro support  
- ✅ **Theme Manager**: Updated fallback method with pomodoro logic

### 3. **Robust Error Handling**
- ✅ **Uninitialized editor**: Timer works even when UI isn't fully loaded
- ✅ **Guard conditions**: Prevents crashes during startup/shutdown
- ✅ **Callback safety**: Timer callbacks handle missing UI components gracefully

## 🎯 How to Use the Fixed Timer

### Quick Start
1. **Open any story**: `writers write my-story`
2. **Start timer**: Press `F3` (or `Ctrl+P` if F3 doesn't work)
3. **Check status**: Timer appears in status bar: `🍅 24:30 ▶️`
4. **Pause/resume**: Press `F3`/`Ctrl+P` again
5. **View details**: Press `F4` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`
6. **Reset**: Press `Shift+F3` or `Ctrl+R`

### Status Bar Display
When active, the timer shows in your status bar:
```
INSERT | 📝 story.md | Ln 45, Col 12 | 543 words | 🍅 23:45 ▶️ (2)
                                                   │   │    │  │
                                                   │   │    │  └─ Completed count  
                                                   │   │    └─ Status icon
                                                   │   └─ Time remaining
                                                   └─ Phase icon
```

### Status Icons
- **🍅** - Work/Focus sessions (25 minutes)
- **☕** - Break periods (5 or 15 minutes)  
- **▶️** - Timer running
- **⏸️** - Timer paused
- **⏹️** - Timer stopped

### Timer Phases
1. **Work Session**: 25 minutes of focused writing
2. **Short Break**: 5 minutes after each work session
3. **Long Break**: 15 minutes after every 4 completed Pomodoros

## 🛠️ If F3 Still Doesn't Work

### Use Alternative Keys
Instead of F3, use **Ctrl+P**:
- `Ctrl+P` = Start/pause timer
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` = Show timer info
- `Ctrl+R` = Reset timer

### Check Your Terminal
Some terminals intercept F3. Try:
- Different terminal emulator
- Check terminal key mappings
- Use the Ctrl+ alternatives instead

### Manual Verification
The timer logic works perfectly. You can verify by:
1. Starting the editor
2. Using `Ctrl+P` to start timer
3. Watching the status bar for timer display
4. Using `Ctrl+Shift+P` to see detailed status
