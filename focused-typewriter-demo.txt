## Writing Flow Demonstration

This section demonstrates how typewriter mode enhances the writing experience.

### Traditional Writing Challenges:
- Cursor drifts to bottom of screen as you type
- Previous content remains distractingly visible
- Eyes constantly adjust to different cursor positions
- Hard to maintain focus on current work

### Focused Typewriter Mode Solutions:
- Cursor stays at consistent 2/3 position on screen
- Previous content fades to gray, reducing visual noise
- Only current work area (3 lines total) stays bright
- Creates a natural "spotlight" effect on your writing

## Test Your Writing Experience

Position your cursor below this line and start typing a story, journal entry, or any content. Notice how:

- The focus window follows your cursor
- Completed text dims automatically
- You maintain focus on current work
- No manual scrolling needed
- Distraction-free writing environment

---

## Feature Comparison

### Normal Mode:
- All text equally bright
- Cursor position varies
- Easy to get distracted by previous content
- Manual scrolling required

### Typewriter Mode with Focused Window:
- Only 3 lines bright (current + 1 above + 1 below)
- Cursor stays at optimal position
- Previous content dimmed but still readable
- Automatic scrolling
- Enhanced concentration

## Advanced Testing

Try these scenarios to fully experience the feature:

1. **Navigation Test**: Use arrow keys to move through this document
   - Watch how the focus window slides smoothly
   - Notice dimmed content above and below

2. **Writing Test**: Go to the end and type several paragraphs
   - See how completed text automatically dims
   - Experience the distraction-free writing zone

3. **Editing Test**: Move to middle of document and edit existing text
   - Focus window works for editing too
   - Easy to concentrate on specific sections

4. **Toggle Test**: Press F9 to turn typewriter mode on/off
   - Compare the difference in visual focus
   - Normal mode shows all text equally

## Configuration Notes

The focused window is configurable:
- Default: Current line Â± 1 line (3 total)
- Can be adjusted in settings
- Saved per project in writers.config.json

## Long Content for Scrolling Test

Here are many lines to test the scrolling behavior. When typewriter mode is enabled, you should see the focus window move smoothly as you navigate through this content.

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Enable typewriter mode first** (F9) before starting to write
2. **Use a dark terminal theme** for better contrast with dimmed text
3. **Adjust terminal size** - larger windows provide more context
4. **Combine with distraction-free mode** (F11) for maximum focus
5. **Toggle off when reviewing** - normal mode better for editing existing content

## Conclusion

The focused typewriter mode transforms your writing experience by:
- Creating a natural spotlight on current work
- Reducing visual distractions from completed content
- Maintaining optimal cursor positioning
- Providing smooth, automatic scrolling
- Enhancing concentration and writing flow
