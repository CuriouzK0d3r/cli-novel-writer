# Blog Categories

This folder organizes your blog posts by category. Each category can have its own subfolder.

## Usage

1. Create category folders as needed (e.g., `technology/`, `personal/`, `tutorials/`)
2. Move or copy published posts into appropriate category folders
3. Use category names in your post frontmatter
4. Export by category for themed content

## Tips

- Use clear, descriptive category names
- Keep categories broad enough to have multiple posts
- Consider your blog's main themes when creating categories
- Update post metadata when moving between categories
