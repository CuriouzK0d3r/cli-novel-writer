#
# Simple helper script to install FFmpeg on macOS using Homebrew.
# - Detects macOS
# - Checks for Homebrew and offers to install it (unless --yes is passed)
# - Installs/updates Homebrew and installs FFmpeg
# - Verifies installation (runs `ffmpeg -version`)
#
# Usage:
#   bash install-ffmpeg-macos.sh        # interactive
#   bash install-ffmpeg-macos.sh --yes  # non-interactive (assume Yes)
#
# NOTE:
# - This script runs commands that may require network access and user privileges.
# - Installing Homebrew will run the official Homebrew install script if chosen.
# - Homebrew's install location differs on Apple Silicon vs Intel Macs:
#     - Apple Silicon: /opt/homebrew
#     - Intel: /usr/local
#
